            It's 2017. All of us browse the web and have an online presence.<br />
            Most of us however, lack a personal website that will allow us to
            reign over our online persona. With this website I hope to help you
            create, edit, and showcase a public page about yourself The setup
            process is quick and simple and aims to provide you with a simple,
            modern online card.<br />
